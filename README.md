To Run -

2. Run "python3 finalVideoScrapper.py".
3. The user is prompted to enter either a number of campaigns they'd want to look at or enter ALL in case you want it to go through every campaign on the website.
4. Script runs to populate a folder AdsOfTheWorld with the videos and a video_data.son for the corresponding metadata.
