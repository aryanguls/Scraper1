Scrapping video from the website

To Run - 
1. Clone repo 
2. Run "python3 finalVideoScrapper.py" (after you have seen the samples you can also just delete the video directory and the json and run it to see how it populates per campaign).
3. The user is prompted to enter either a number of campaigns they'd want to look at or enter ALL in case you want it to go through every campaign on the website.
4. Script runs to populate a folder AdsOfTheWorld with the videos and a video_data.json for the corresponding metadata.
